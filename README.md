## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, that would be awesome. While I encourage you to submit a pull request (PR) with any suggestions you might have, know that I may be slow to review them.

To make the process easier and faster, please consider the following when making the pull request:

1. Have you fully implemented the fix or suggestion without breaking anything else?
2. Does the PR title make clear what you intend to have merged?
3. Has your description of the PR clearly and concisely (less than 3-5 sentences) the problem you found and how you are suggesting to fix it?

Thank you all in advance for your time.
