## Work at your own pace
There is no grade for this training and GitHub Education staff does not review your work, so feel free to explore at your own pace. We hope the training will help you get started with GitHub and GitHub Education.

## This is your training

It is beneficial that you take advantage of the resources presented to you, but if you find instances where things can be improved, please create an issue in the original repository [here](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training/issues/new?assignees=arelia&labels=suggestion&template=suggestion.md&title=%5BSUGGESTION%5D+Suggestion+title). If you are not familiar with issues in GitHub, no worries, you will learn about them soon.

## Questions
Replit has great tools for asking questions. Here are a few...
1. You can use the `Docs` section in "Tools" on the left-hand sidebar. If you do not see the sidebar, click the square in the top left courner to toggle it on.
2. If you highlight the section in the editor you have a question about, a button with `Start Thread` appears. Click it to start a thread to ask your question.
3. You can also right-click or two-finger-click to get a menu with an option to start a thread.
4. Lastly, the `Chat` button in the top right lets you start a chat to ask or discuss general questions.
