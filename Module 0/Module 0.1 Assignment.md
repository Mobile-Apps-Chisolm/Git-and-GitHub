# Assignment 0.1: Getting Started

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).

  ## Local Setup Only 
	- Skip to step 3 when completing on Replit
 	- Only complete step 2 on Mac, Linux, or Windows, locally.
2. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads), install, and [configure](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) git. Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, we recommend [downloading VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. VS Code will be used in all modules.

#### Mac Setup
If you are using a Mac machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the VS Code
- [VS Code Setup Instructions for Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)

#### Linux Setup
If you are using a Linux machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the VS Code
- [VS Code Setup Instructions for Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

#### Chromebook User Setup
If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use VS Code on the web using a web browser:
- [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/)

#### Windows User Setup
If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:
- [VS Code Setup Instructions for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)
- // ADD LINK TO INSTRUCTIONS TO SWITCH FROM POWERSHELL

3. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line (i.e. Shell) with your name and email address:
```
$ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
Git will use this information when you work on a project.
